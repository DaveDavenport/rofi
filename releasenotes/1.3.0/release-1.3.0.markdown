# V1.3.0: Dan vs. Greg: The never ending story.

This release mostly focussed on cleaning up, refactoring and more. On of the big changes is that the gui is no longer
based on hard-coded positions. We introduced a widget system with boxes, scrollbars, separators, listview and textboxes.
The boxes (vertical and horizontal) allows us to nice structure the layout and have them resize according to rules when
the window changes size.

This allowed us to make changes at run-time. In the future I hope we can use this to improve the theming.  The cleanup
and refactoring is not finished and will continue for the next release.

Beside this we still managed to get some new features in:

## Dynamic window size

Rofi can now resize the window to fit the number of visible entries, so as you type and the list of options becomes
small, so does the windows (this is disabled by default). Rofi will try to keep the text box at the same place so you
don't have to move focus, this means that at the bottom of the screen the window layout is reversed so the textbox is at
the bottom.

### Theme selector

To make it easier to get a good looking rofi, we included a theme-selector script and ship rofi with a set of themes.
The script allows you to preview themes, and make them the default theme.

### Fuzzy parser

On many request, the fuzzy matcher has been re-added:

### ASync DMENU

Rofi can read input data for dmenu asynchronous from displaying. So if you have something that takes a time to produce,
you can see the progress, already start filtering and selecting entries before it finishes.
This can be very useful when searching through large data sets.
In the below screenshot it keeps feeding rofi the content of the directory. Rofi indicates it is still receiving data by
the `loading...` text.

Async mode is not always possible, and will be disabled if not possible.

## Removals

We also removed a deprecated option, `-opacity`. Did option did full window opacity, basically it makes the whole window
and text transparent. A very ugly effect. The current argb colors in the theme allow a nice transparency, where only the
background of the window is transparent but not the text (you can still reproduce the old style in the new theme format,
by making all colors transparent).
