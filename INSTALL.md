# Installation guide

## DEPENDENCY

### For building:

* C compiler that supports the c99 standard. (gcc or clang)
* make
* autoconf
* automake
* Dev packages of the external libraries

### External libraries

* libxinerama
* libxft
* libpango
* libx11


### Optional:

* For i3 support, you need at least i3 version 4.5 or up.
Make sure that 'i3/ipc.h' is included. If it fails please check 
config.log.



## Install from a release

Check dependencies and configure build system:

```
./configure
```

Build Rofi:

```
make
```

The actual install, execute as root (if needed):

```
make install
```


## Install a checkout from git

Generate build system:

```
autoreconf -i
```

Create a build directory:

```
mkdir build
```

Check dependencies and configure build system:

```
./configure
```

Build rofi:

```
make
```

The actual install, execute as root (if needed):

```
make install
```


## Options for configure

When you run the configure step there are several you can configure. (To see the full list type
`./configure --help` ).

The most useful one to set the installation prefix:

```
./configure --prefix=<installation path>
```

f.e.

```
./configure --prefix=/usr/
```

### Install locally

or to install locally:

```
./configure --prefix=${HOME}/.local/
```

###  I3 workaround

 If i3 is installed in a non-standard prefix, point it to the right location using:

```
CFLAGS="-I/weird/i3/path/include/" ../configure
CFLAGS="-I/weird/i3/path/include/" make
```
