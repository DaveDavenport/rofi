**Before creating a feature request:**
- First check the *next* branch, to see if the feature has already been
  implemented.
- Check existing reports, see if it is already requested.


**Describe the feature**
- A clear description of the feature you want added.
- If the feature involves replacement of current functionality, how the new
  functionality is better?
- If the feature is implemented in another application, include:
  - Screenshots or screencasts of it
  - Links to its implementation
- If possible try to explain how you would expect to use feature:
  For example, should it be a configuration option or a hot-key. 


**When reporting a feature request include the following information:**
- Rofi version:
  - `rofi -v`


**Requesting a feature is no guarantee it will be added.**
